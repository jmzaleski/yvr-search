Criteria

1. Location: We talked about the south boundary of our search area should be roughly where the commercialization ends on Main. Call it 33rd Ave. (btw, i just realized that in Golden streets run east-west whereas in vancouver it's avenues. sorry for any historical confusion on this point). BTW, we're pretty comfortable with hippy dippy types so long as their dogs don't give Rufus fleas.

2. Walking neighbourhood. means walk to shopping and walk to dog park. walking along arterial access roads (like 41st ave or main south of mid 30s)  doesn't count. Decent health food store pretty desirable.  

Plus, "all above factors being equal" 

3. Car commute/access a) to squamish hence nice to have decent access to both bridges and to transcan east b) bike access to beaches and sailing clubs on english bay

and late breaking news:

4. Will consider a reasonable level of fixer upper -- like new kitchen and bathroom hvac and flooring and maybe a few windows. Scenario would be that a building inspection declared the building to have a healthy structure and roof but to make it nice, comfortable and energy efficient it needs some modernizing. A special case of this that appears quite common would be to fully or partially convert a basement suite back to living space.
